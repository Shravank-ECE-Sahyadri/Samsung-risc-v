## Task 1 :
Task is to install RISC-V toolchain using VDI link provided,Compiling the C code and Using RISV options O1 and Ofast

## Task 2 :
Run and observe the performance of SPIKE Simulation and under the -O1 and -Ofast Compiler optimization flags

## Task 3 :
15 unique instructions are determined in the riscv-objdump of code,As it gives exact 32-bit instruction code in their respective instruction type formats.

## Task 4: 
By using RISC-V Core: Verilog netlist and Testbench, perform an experiment of Functional Simulation using GTKWave and Observe the waveforms.

## Task 5: 
Task is to implement any digital circuits using VSDSquadron Mini and check whether the building and uploading of C program file on RISCV processor works
